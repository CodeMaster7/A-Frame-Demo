# A-Frame and React Workshop for DevMountain

Much of this demo has already been beautifully documented by Megan Fisher. For a step-by-step guide on how to setup A-Frame in React, please navigate to "Megans-Repo" to view her README.md file. She has also included several good resources for additional research at the bottom of her README. 

"tiarras-demo" contains the code used for this specific workshop and includes the use of "text". 

To find equirectangular photos, you can try "https://www.flickr.com/groups/equirectangular/". I found several great photos from Adobe Stock. You can sign up for a free trial of Adobe Stock to access a few photos. 

A-Frame has a Slack channel here (https://aframevr-slack.herokuapp.com/) where you can get help, discuss ideas, and view projects. 

I also enjoyed this tutorial when learning about React and A-Frame: https://www.viget.com/articles/creating-your-first-webvr-app/.
