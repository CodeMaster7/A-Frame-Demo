# A-Frame with Create-React-App Demo

## Step 1: 

Run `create-react-app` in the root of your project folder. 

```
create-react-app app
```

After your app has been created cd into it and run `npm start`.

``` 
cd app && npm start
```

## Step 2: 

Install required dependencies: 
  - aframe
  - aframe-animation-component
  - aframe-particle-system-component
  - aframe-react
  - babel-polyfill

To do this you can run the following in your terminal: 
  
  ```
  npm i aframe aframe-animation-component aframe-particle-system-component aframe-react babel-polyfill
  ```

## Step 3 

Now import all of those dependancies into your app.js. We will need to import Entity and Scene from aframe-react.

```
import 'aframe';
import 'aframe-animation-component';
import 'aframe-particle-system-component';
import 'babel-polyfill';
import {Entity, Scene} from 'aframe-react';
```


## Step 4 

Inside the return remove what create-react-app gave you and add just a Scene tag. 
<Scene>
</Scene>

```
class App extends Component {

  render() {
    return (
      <Scene>

      </Scene>
    )
  }
}
```


## Step 5 

We will now add our first Entity tag. 

A-Frame provides a handful of elements such as `a-box` or `a-sky` called primitives that wrap the entity-component pattern to make it appealing for beginners. Developers can create their own primitives as well. 

For our first entity we will be using `a-sky`. Within the Entity tag add primitive and set it equal to a-sky.

The sky primitive adds a background color or 360Â° image to a scene. A sky is a large sphere with a color or texture mapped to the inside.

```
<Entity primitive="a-sky" />
```

We now need to add a background image to the sky. We will be using the following image for this demo:

```
<Entity primitive="a-sky" src="https://ucarecdn.com/19a73c27-dc44-4e15-9d49-e93fd70d8014/" />
```
